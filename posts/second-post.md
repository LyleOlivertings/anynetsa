Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is not just about keywords and backlinks anymore. For modern web applications built with frameworks like Next.js, a technical approach is essential for success.

## Key SEO Areas for SPAs

### 1. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
Ensure that your critical content is rendered on the server so that search engine crawlers can see it immediately without needing to execute JavaScript.

### 2. Dynamic Metadata
Each page should have unique `title` and `meta description` tags. Next.js makes this easy with its Metadata API.

### 3. Structured Data
Implement JSON-LD schema to help Google understand the content of your pages. This can lead to rich snippets in search results, increasing your click-through rate.
