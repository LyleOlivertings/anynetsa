In today's digital age, attention spans are shorter than ever. Users expect websites to load almost instantly. If your site takes more than a few seconds to load, you risk losing a significant portion of your visitors

## Why Speed Matters

### 1. User Experience (UX)
A slow website creates a frustrating user experience. Visitors are likely to abandon a page that doesn't load quickly, leading to high bounce rates.

### 2. SEO Rankings
Search engines like Google consider page speed as a ranking factor. A faster website can lead to better visibility in search results, driving more organic traffic.

### 3. Conversion Rates
For business websites, speed is directly tied to revenue. A delay of just one second in page load time can result in a significant drop in conversions.
